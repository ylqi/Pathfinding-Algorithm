# A pathfinding algorithm for self-driving delivery vehicles

## Task description
The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
